# Weather App

This project is a Weather Progressive Web App developed with HTML, ReactJS and CSS. I wanted to explore how these technologies could work together to build something functional and user-friendly. By diving into the development process, I aimed to gain hands-on experience and showcase my skills in modern web development techniques. The end result was a project that not only served as a learning experience but also demonstrated my ability to leverage the latest tools and frameworks effectively.

# How to setup

1. Extract files
2. Open node command line and browse to directory location
3. Install app (npm install)
4. Run app (npm start)

# Features

* Dynamic Image Display: Based on the temperature, the app dynamically switches between displaying a "warm" image when the temperature is above 15 degrees and a "cold" image when it's below 15 degrees, offering users an immediate visual cue of the weather conditions.
* Real-Time Weather Data: Utilizing an API, the app continuously fetches real-time weather data, ensuring that users always have up-to-date information on the current weather conditions in their location.
* Detailed Weather Information: Alongside temperature, the app provides comprehensive weather details such as cloud cover, rainfall status, wind speed, and other relevant meteorological data, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of the current weather situation.
* Date Display: The app prominently displays the current date, ensuring users are informed about the day and date alongside the weather information, enhancing the overall usability and relevance of the application.
  

# How does it work?

This app allows users to easily check the weather for any city worldwide. It not only provides current weather conditions but also gives information about different weather types, making it a handy tool for staying informed about atmospheric conditions anywhere you go.

# Comments

This project was a lot of fun and served as my first venture into developing a Progressive Web App (PWA). I experimented with several new features, like dynamically changing images based on temperature and providing real-time weather updates. While I faced challenges with CSS and image loading initially, I managed to overcome them by researching and learning different solutions. This experience not only helped me resolve the issues but also enhanced my understanding of CSS, ultimately improving my web development skills.

# Weather App

This project was my first Progressive Web App and was created with ReactJS & CSS.

# How to setup

1. Extract files
2. Open node command line and browse to directory location
3. Install app (npm install)
4. Run app (npm start)

# Features

* When temperture is over 15 degrees, it shows a "warm" image and if below 15 degrees it shows a "cold" image
* Pulls weather data from an API
* Provides weather type ie clouds, rain etc
* Provides current date


# How does it work?

This app works by searching the weather of any city around the world, it provides the user with information regarding the weather type aswell.

# Comments

This project was alot of fun and is the first PWA I have created, I implemented several different features that I hadnt done before like changing images regarding the temperature and providing real time weather type updates. I had issues regarding the CSS and making my images load, I overcame this which helped me upgrade my knowledge of CSS by educating myself on different solutions.
